# blowfish-openapi-specs

This is a public repository containing all [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specs for the various versions of the Blowfish API.

## Comparing versions

You can use these specifications to generate a diff of exactly what changed between the version you're currently using and any other version you might want to update to. To do so, you could use the following command:

```
diff ./v20220601.yaml ./v20230308.yaml
```

Replacing `v20220601.yml` with the version you're currently using and `v20230308.yml` with the version you'd like to upgrade to.

Note: To see a side-by-side diff, add the `-y` flag before the file paths in the command above.
