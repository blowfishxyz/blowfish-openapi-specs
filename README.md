# blowfish-openapi-specs [DEPRECATED]

Use https://api.blowfish.xyz/openapi/ instead.

## Comparing versions

You can use these specifications to generate a diff of exactly what changed between the version you're currently using and any other version you might want to update to. To do so, you could use the following command after downloading the spec's locally:

```
diff ./v20220601.yaml ./v20230308.yaml
```

Replacing `v20220601.yml` with the version you're currently using and `v20230308.yml` with the version you'd like to upgrade to.

Note: To see a side-by-side diff, add the `-y` flag before the file paths in the command above.
